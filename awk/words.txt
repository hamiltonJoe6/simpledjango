Now that the input is separated into records, the second step is to separate
the fields in the records. One way to do this is to divide each of the lines 
into fields in the normal manner. This happens by default as the result of a 
special feature. When RS is set to the empty string and FS is set to a single
character, the newline character always acts as a field separator. This is in
addition to whatever field separations result from FS.
